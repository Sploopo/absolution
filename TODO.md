## Fargo changes
- Change the effect of the Eridanus armor to require double-tapping DOWN instead of the time-based bullshittery

- Remove Celestial Shell from Berserker's Soul
## Calamity changes
- Cause the Abyss to kill you without defeating certain bosses (layer 1: Piglin Brute (ignore for now), layer 2: Plantera, layer 3: Old Duke, layer 4: Abominationn)
- Prevent Anahita from spawning until Calamitas has been defeated
- Destroy Profaned Guardians dropping Profaned Core
- Outlaw Titan Hearts being usable at Astral Beacon, change Starcore to require Infected Armor Plating

- Replace the Terminus in the Abyss with the Inactive Terminus (must be activated with Eternal Energy)
- Add Cosmic Plushie to a shop post-DoG for 10 platinum
