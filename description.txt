This is the core mod for the Absolution Modpack - the first Terraria modpack that actually has balancing.
Absolution is a modpack containing four content mods: Fargo's Souls, Calamity, Thorium, and Redemption. All of these mods have been engineered to play together as well as possible, mainly through balancing and progression tweaks.
This mod also makes the game much more difficult (or, at least, grindier) through a large number of recipe changes that either make the recipes larger or locked behind phases of progression. If you don't want this, you can turn on "Unbound Mode" in the config.
